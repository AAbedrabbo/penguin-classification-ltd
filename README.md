# Penguin Classification Services Ltd. 
This app is only a prototype -- a flavour if you will -- for the multi-trillion Â£ idea of classifying penguins. 

It serves as a simple demo of going from Jupyter Notebooks to deployed application, using Flask. 

## Usage 
This app is currently live on the web, and runs on a Heroku Dyno. 

You can check the live app via this URL: https://penguin-classification-ltd.herokuapp.com/.
