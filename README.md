# Penguin Classification Services Ltd. 
This app is only a prototype -- a flavour if you will -- for the multi-trillion Â£ idea of classifying penguins. 

It serves as a simple demo of going from Jupyter Notebooks to deployed application, using Flask. 



## Data 
Data was obtained from [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data), which in turn sourced the data from [this Github repo](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).
